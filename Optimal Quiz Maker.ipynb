    "In this Project, I use several classifiers, along with a survey dataset to guess how a user would answer a question. The way this happens is through a quiz. First, the user enters how many questions they want to answer, then, they enter what question from the survey they want the program to predict their answer to. Once this is done, the program finds the most optimal questions to ask, and then build a classifier based on the answers to those questions. After this, the user is prompted to answer these questions, the answers are recorded, and a prediction is made."
